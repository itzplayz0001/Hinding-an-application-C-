# Hinding-an-application-C-
Can be used to hide your application or probably a spyware? I made this for a client, this basically installs a file to a specific path.

Cretes a directory in C:\Windows and installs an application to that directory and launches it.

Also creates a Regkey for auto launch

```Using System.IO;```
```Using System.Net;```
